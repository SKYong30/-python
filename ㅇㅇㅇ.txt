This study explored whether time management and depression mediate in the relationship between grit(continuation of effort) and academic adaptation among Chinese international students in Korea. 
To this end, a total of 546 Chinese international students who enrolled in universities located in Seoul, Korea(143 male students and 403 female students) were subject to the final analysis. As a result of this study, 
it was found that there was a significant positive correlation between grit(continuation of effort) and time management and academic adaptation percived by Chinese international students in Korea. On the other hand, depression was found to have a significant negative correlation with other factors. 
As a result of analyzing the difference between studying abroad types(undergraduate and graduate students), graduate students showed a higher level of grit(continuation of effort) than undergraduate students. 
In addition, graduate students showed a higher level of academic adaptation than undergraduates, especially the level of 'motivation' and 'performance' was found to be higher. 
Finally, it was found that time management and depression were fully mediated in the relationship between grit and academic adaptation. 
This study, which explored the structural relationship between gri, time management, depression, and academic adaptation of Chinese international students in Korea, is expected to help them explore the academic performance of international students in Korea
